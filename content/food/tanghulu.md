A traditional Chinese snack made out of fruits skewered on bamboo sticks that are coated in a crispy shell of sugar.

**Ingredients**
- Bamboo Skewers
- 2 cups Granulated Sugar 
- 1 cup Water
- Strawberries or other fruit of choice

**Steps**
1. Wash and pat dry strawberries or fruit of choice.
2. Arrange fruit on a skewer. I recommend 1-3 pieces per skewer.
3. Bring water and sugar mixture to a boil.
4. Using a thermometer, boil sugar water mixture until the temperature reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit. This will take approximately 5-10 minutes.
If you do not have a thermometer, you can test the temperature by dipping a spoon into cold ice water and then dipping the spoon into the syrup. If it hardens immediately, then you have reached the proper temperature.
5. When sugar water mixture has reached the desired temperature, dip your fruit skewer into the sugar mixture to coat the fruit.
6. Place each fruit skewer on your sheet pan, silicone baking sheet or parchment paper. If your parchment paper is not good quality, your candy may stick to the paper. You can spray parchment paper with pan spray to help prevent sticking.
7. Sugarcoating should harden almost immediately. This recipe is best eaten right away. If you need to store, cover lightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator
