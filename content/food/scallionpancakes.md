A thin crepe-like savory pancake with an egg cooked into it and rolled together with the filling of your choice.

**Ingredients**
- 2-3 green onions
- 1 cup of all-purpose flour
- 1 egg
- ¼ cup of water
- 1 tablespoon  of olive oil

**Steps**
1. Whisk an egg in a bowl. Mix the egg with flour until it sticks together.
2. Then, slowly pour in the water and knead the dough in between. Make sure you don’t over pour the water. Do it in increments and you may or may not have excess water or might need a little bit more until the dough is only slightly sticky to your hands.
3. Cover the dough with plastic wrap to seal the air and let it rise for 30 minutes or so.
4. During that time, you can start to prepare the green onions. Wash and cut the green onions into small pieces and mix it with the salt and olive oil.
5. After 30 minutes, roll the dough out into 4 pieces. Set 3 aside and take a roller to flatten out the dough into a circular oval shape. Make sure it’s not too thin or thick.
6. Spread the green onion mixture onto the dough evenly. Make sure not to use too much olive oil. You can sprinkle more salt on top of the layer (based on preference).
7. Then start rolling from one end to the other and swirling the dough into a Cinnabon type shape. Make sure the ends are tucked in and/or closed. After, flatten it out gently, and if some of the scallion mixture comes out it is ok!
8. Repeat steps 5-7 for each piece of dough.
9. After heating up the pan, make sure you have oil on it so it won’t stick. You can start frying! Enjoy!
